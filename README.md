# ask

A cross-platform AI chat app capable of utilising both Local and Online LLMs.

## Introducing Undetectable Mode
This app is also designed to be able to hide from any screen sharing app,
including Google Meet, Zoom, MS Teams and you name it. So you can ask questions and get your answers anytime without being judged by the overlords ogling at your shared screen. Just a simple toggle and boom! The whole thing is invisible to the world.

This is my way of formally protesting the fucked up & outdated industry standards when it comes to screening candidates for tech jobs. Some of us are more interested in getting some actual work done and build something meaningful rather than mugging hundreds of DSA problems and spewing it in interviews... 

BTW, if you still fail the interview or for some reason get caught, it's not on me. I'm not charging any money for this so can't really blame me. 

Oh! And, FUCK LEETCODE...

Good Luck.
